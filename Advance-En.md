## Custom App Plugin

The Custom App plugin extends the whiteboard functionality, and users write js code to implement their own whiteboard plugin.

To operate the Custom App plugin you need to use `WhiteSDK` and `WhiteRoom` objects, both of which can be found in `FastRoom`.

The corresponding property names are `whiteSDK` and `room`.

Custom App plugin details can be found in [Whiteboard-README-CustomApp](https://github.com/netless-io/Whiteboard-iOS/blob/master/README.md#custom-app-plugin)
